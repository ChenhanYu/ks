GSKS (General Stride Kernel Summation)
README
---

Thank you for deciding to give GSKS a try!
This code can be used for direct kernel summation.

See INSTALL on how to install it. 

Kernel summation appears in N-body algorithms for scientific computing 
and machine learning. 

GSKS (General Stride Kernel Summation) is a portable framework that
provides a high performance memory efficient kernel summation based
on the BLIS framework.

GSKS has several features. For further details of this project, please
check the Githup repo:

Thank you again for being intersted in GSKS!

Best regards,
