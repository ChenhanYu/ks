The GSKS library was primarily authored by

  Chenhan D. Yu             (The University of Texas at Austin)

but many others have contributed input and feedback, including:

  Field Van Zee             (The University of Texas at Austin)
  Tyler Smith               (The University of Texas at Austin)
  Bill March                (The University of Texas at Austin)
  George Biros              (The University of Texas at Austin)

The gratitude especially goes to the following individual who walks
me through the whole BLIS framework.
