GSKS (General Stride Kernel Summation)
INSTALL
---

GSKS is tested on LINUX and OSX
REQUIRES Intel compilers and MKL. 

LINUX:
edit  set_env.sh and make.inc to set the paths to the libraries. 

OSX: 
edit  set_env_osx.sh and make.osx.inc to set the paths to the libraries. 
edit the first line in makefile to change make.inc to make.osx.inc 

For LINUX (and similarly for OSX)
>source set_env.sh
>make

GSKS requires c and c++ compilers that support OpenMP, and the
default micro-kernel (uses AVX) requires the a Sandy-Bridge
processor or any successor. 

The current reference function requires the support of the MKL
library which will be changed in the future. The default 
compilation will also compile all the test drivers. To run
some basic example from the testing drivers:

>cd test
>./run_dgsks.sh
>./run_dgsks_list.sh

To us GSKS library you need to include the
header files <ks.h> and <omp_dgsks_list.h> 
and link GSKS statically wich is in ${KS_DIR}/lib/libks.a.

C/C++ example:
...
#include <ks.h>
#include <omp_dgsks_list.h>
...

Compilation example:
>icc ... -I$(KS_DIR)/include $(KS_DIR)/lib/libks.a
