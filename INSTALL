GSKS (General Stride Kernel Summation)
INSTALL
---

To install GSKS is to use makefile.
GSKS has been tested on OSX and Linux. 


You should edit 
    set_env.sh  or set_env_osx.sh
and 
     make.inc  or make.osx.inc
to set variables to match your system.

OSX: edit the first line in makefile to change make.inc to make.osx.inc

For LINUX:
>source set_env.sh
>make

GSKS requires c and c++ compilers that support OpenMP, and the
default micro-kernel (uses AVX) requires the a Sandy-Bridge
processor or any successor. We have tested GNU and Intel compilers.

The current reference function requires the support of the MKL
library which will be changed in the future. The default 
compilation will also compile all the test drivers. To run
some basic example from the testing drivers:

>cd test
>./run_dgsks.sh
>./run_dgsks_list.sh

To embed GSKS in a specific application, you need to include the
header files <ks.h> and <omp_dgsks_list.h> 
and link GSKS statically with lib/libks.a.

C/C++ example:
...
#include <ks.h>
#include <omp_dgsks_list.h>
...

Compilation example:
>gcc ... -I$(KS_DIR)/include $(KS_DIR)/lib/libks.a
